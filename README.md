# LubbDubb

A self-hosted, always-running **orchestration harness** for one software engineer's work — a *cockpit* that watches your inputs (PRs, CI, review comments, backlog, calendar), decides what to do on a heartbeat, and dispatches AI agents to do it autonomously, escalating to you only what genuinely needs judgment.

The name is the heartbeat: the server's core is a periodic pulse that drives everything.

> **v1 status — walking skeleton.** The harness *core* is built and tested end-to-end. Real DevOps/calendar/Gmail connectors, metric-driven prioritization, and confidence-gated auto-send are designed *around* but deliberately **not** built yet. See [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-lubbdubb-harness-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-lubbdubb-harness-design.md).

## What it does

Every heartbeat (or immediately when an event is injected) the harness:

1. **Snapshots** the world via a `Connector` (v1: a `FakeConnector` you can inject events into).
2. **Dispatches** — hands the full state to a decision engine that returns a **bounded, schema-validated action plan**.
3. **Guards & executes** — de-duplicates work already in flight, enforces a concurrency cap, then runs each action, spawning Claude Code agents in git worktrees (code tasks) or scratch dirs (desk tasks).
4. **Escalates** anything it can't safely decide to a human inbox.
5. **Audits** every decision and action, with reasons.

The default priorities (encoded in the `RuleDispatcher`) come straight from the product vision:

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| A PR's CI is failing | Spin up a code agent to fix it |
| A PR has an unhandled review comment | Spin up a code agent to address/defend |
| A meeting today lacks prep | Desk agent reads the docs and summarises |
| A ready story lacks a description / acceptance criteria | Desk agent drafts them |
| A ready story lacks WAF pillars | Desk agent fills them in |
| Idle capacity | Pick up the highest-priority ready story |
| Nothing actionable | `no_op` (still recorded, so idleness is auditable) |

## Architecture

A single Node/TypeScript process (HTTP + WebSocket) built as isolated modules that talk only through interfaces — any one (especially the `Connector`) can be swapped without touching the rest.

```
inject ─► Connector ◄── Heartbeat ──► Dispatcher ──► ActionExecutor ──► AgentManager ──► PtySession(s)
             │ (Fake)      (pulse)     (rule|claude)    │ guard/cap          │                │ node-pty
             └── Store (SQLite) ◄───────────────────────┴── EscalationInbox  └── WorktreeManager
                                                            CockpitAPI + WebSocket ──► Cockpit SPA (React)
```

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Heartbeat` | The pulse — a timer that fires a dispatch cycle; can also be triggered on demand. |
| `Connector` | The seam to the outside world. `FakeConnector` is an editable, persisted world you inject events into. |
| `Dispatcher` | State in → validated action plan out. `RuleDispatcher` (deterministic default) or `ClaudeDispatcher` (drives a real Claude Code session over a PTY). |
| `ActionExecutor` | Turns actions into effects; origin de-dup + concurrency cap; writes the audit log. |
| `AgentManager` | Owns the fleet of PTY agent sessions: spawn, stream, detect waiting/done, feed input, kill. |
| `PtySession` | **All** the PTY waiting/done heuristics, isolated behind one testable abstraction (the top technical risk). |
| `WorktreeManager` | Lazily creates/reuses git worktrees keyed by branch — code tasks only. |
| `EscalationInbox` | The human-in-the-loop surface; routes answers into live agents or the next cycle. |
| `Store` | SQLite persistence + reconcile-on-restart. |
| `Cockpit SPA` | The single web page: fleet, inbox, world, live agent output, decision log, inject + kill. |

## Getting started

```bash
npm install          # builds native deps (better-sqlite3, node-pty)
npm run web:build    # build the cockpit SPA into web/dist
npm start            # start the server (serves the cockpit at http://localhost:4300)
```

Then open the cockpit, use the **Inject event** bar to simulate the world moving (a CI failure, a review comment, a new story, a meeting), and watch the harness react. Click an agent to see its live terminal and type into it; answer items in **Needs you** to unblock parked agents.

### Configuration

Create `lubbdubb.config.json` at the repo root (all keys optional):

```json
{
  "heartbeatIntervalMs": 300000,
  "maxConcurrentAgents": 3,
  "dispatcher": "rule",
  "claudeCommand": "claude",
  "claudeArgs": [],
  "whitelistedApprovals": [{ "match": "Allow running tests", "response": "yes" }],
  "steeringPriorities": []
}
```

- **`dispatcher`** — `"rule"` (deterministic, no model calls) or `"claude"` (an LLM decides each cycle, output still schema-validated).
- **`claudeCommand` / `claudeArgs`** — how an agent session is launched. Defaults to `claude`. The included demo uses a mock agent (see below).
- **`whitelistedApprovals`** — PTY prompts the harness may auto-answer instead of escalating.
- **`steeringPriorities`** — optional hints injected into the LLM dispatcher's prompt.
- Env overrides: `PORT`, `LUBBDUBB_DB`.

### Try the demo without a real model

`scripts/mock-agent.sh` is a stand-in that speaks the same PTY protocol as a real `claude` agent. The committed `lubbdubb.config.json` points at it, so `npm start` works with no model auth. Swap `claudeCommand` back to `claude` for the real thing.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # server with reload
npm run web:dev    # cockpit with HMR (proxies /api + /ws to the server)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # unit + integration tests (node:test)
npm run smoke      # full walking-skeleton E2E with real node-pty + a git worktree
```

### The walking skeleton (Definition of Done)

`npm run smoke` proves the whole loop for real: inject *"CI failed on PR #42"* → the dispatcher decides (with a logged reason) → a Claude-style agent spawns in a reused-or-new git worktree over a PTY → it hits a `waiting` state that **escalates** to the inbox → you answer → it continues → it finishes — and restart reconciliation is clean.

## Safety (v1)

Nothing side-effectful leaves the system autonomously. `reply_on_pr` **drafts** a reply and escalates it for your approval; the harness never posts to a PR or pushes on your behalf without an explicit human action.
